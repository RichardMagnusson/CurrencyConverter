# Currency converter

## General

- Currency Exchange API: [fixer.io](https://fixer.io)
- HTTP-client: [Apollo-client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) using apollo-link-rest for REST API support
- UI-framework: [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/usage/)
- Desired techniques used ✌🏽

Based on starter project, so still run `npm install` and `npm start`

### Note

For REST API calls only, [Axois](https://github.com/axios/axios) or the browser supported [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) might me considered more suitable or atleast sufficient, however I thought it would be nice to incorporate Apollo-client since, if I recall correctly, it is used in your code base :)

### Desired techniques

- TypeScript
- Styled components

To submit the test, simply push your branch and make a pull request to master.

### Requirements

- You should be able to convert an amount in one currency to another.
- You should be able to change what currencies to convert between.
